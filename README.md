This app is my Course project of 6 semester and in that I create an app which allows users to share items 
and add post to there account which can be seen by all users which are on this app if they found somthing 
which was Lost by someone and also the person who lost there item they can check on app if someone found 
it or not and also person can create its lost item post also add picture and description so if someone 
found so they can communicate with each other and also a person can saw its location and phone number.

To run these you have to pull it update to latest dependancies but due to frequent update it may not work so you can
use code and create new react native expo project and run that it uses following services:

-clerk authentication
-firebase firestore 
-lottie animations
-expo-camera
-nativewind

That's all.
